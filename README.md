# alien-invasion
Welcome to "Alien Invasion"! Get set to steer a cool spaceship that appears at the bottom center of your screen. Use the arrow keys to slide left and right, and hit the spacebar to shoot.

As the game starts, get ready for an intergalactic showdown - a gang of quirky aliens fills the sky. It's your mission to zap these space foes before they get you. Knock them all out, and get ready - should you successfully wipe out the entire bunch, get prepared, because an entirely new fleet makes its entrance for round 2.

But here's the deal: don't let those alien troublemakers tag your ship or reach the bottom. You've got three chances (aka three ships) to play with. So gear up and get ready to dodge, shoot, and save the day in this pixel-packed space showdown!
